# Challenge Discription
We recognize the works of artists through their unique style, such as color choices or brush strokes. The “je ne sais quoi” of artists like Claude Monet can now be imitated with algorithms thanks to generative adversarial networks (GANs). In this getting started competition, you will bring that style to your photos or recreate the style from scratch!

Computer vision has advanced tremendously in recent years and GANs are now capable of mimicking objects in a very convincing way. But creating museum-worthy masterpieces is thought of to be, well, more art than science. So can (data) science, in the form of GANs, trick classifiers into believing you’ve created a true Monet? That’s the challenge you’ll take on!
